A C++ library for working with JavaScript Object Notation.

The design of this library makes it especialy suitable for use in embedded
applications. In particular, the design supports:

1. Parse into static structures with no memory allocations
2. Serialize into fixed output buffers with no memory allocations
3. No dependency on the standard library

.. warning::

   While the design of the library enables these features, the current
   implementation doesn't quite meet these goals. For the most part there's
   a few standard library uses that need to be replaced with fixed-memory
   data structures and some of the standard library support is written in the
   same files as the core library. These will be segregated into their own
   files soon.
